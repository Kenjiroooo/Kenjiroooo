📚 Learning Journey: Python & JavaScript & C++/Arduino..

Hello, I'm Kenji D. Sakamoto.

Welcome to my GitHub space where I document and share my progress in learning Python, Arduino, and JavaScript!

🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building foundational skills in Python (scripting, problem-solving, automation).
- Exploring JavaScript for web interactivity and dynamic behavior.
- Creating small projects to apply what I learn and build a portfolio.
- Building Arduino's Projects

🧠 Goals
- Gain proficiency in modern web and software development.
- Combine Python and JavaScript skills for full-stack potential.
- Continuously learn and improve through practice and real-world projects.
- Documenting my school learning journney about software and  also hardware robotics proggramming 

🏅 Certifications I’ve Earned

I’ve earned the Responsive Web Design certificate from freeCodeCamp, which covers:

-HTML & CSS fundamentals
-Flexbox and Grid layout techniques
-Building responsive and accessible web pages

I’ve also earned the Scientific Computing with Python certificate from freeCodeCamp, which focuses on:

-Python fundamentals and problem-solving
-Working with data structures, loops, and functions
-Basic data analysis, algorithms, and computational thinking

This shows my skills in both front-end web development and Python programming for data-focused tasks.
