📚 Learning Journey: Python & JavaScript

Hello, I'm Kenji D. Sakamoto.

Welcome to my GitHub space where I document and share my progress in learning Python and JavaScript!

🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building foundational skills in Python (scripting, problem-solving, automation).
- Exploring JavaScript for web interactivity and dynamic behavior.
- Creating small projects to apply what I learn and build a portfolio.

🧠 Goals
- Gain proficiency in modern web and software development.
- Combine Python and JavaScript skills for full-stack potential.
- Continuously learn and improve through practice and real-world projects.

🏅 Certification
I’ve earned the **Responsive Web Design** certificate from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which covers:

- HTML & CSS fundamentals  
- Flexbox and Grid layout techniques  
- Building responsive, accessible web pages

I studied the fundamentals of Python through freeCodeCamp’s Scientific Computing with Python course, where I learned core programming concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and data structures. By completing hands-on coding challenges and projects, I earned the official freeCodeCamp certification, demonstrating my ability to apply Python for problem-solving and basic scientific computing tasks.I studied the fundamentals of Python through freeCodeCamp’s Scientific Computing with Python course, where I learned core programming concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and data structures.
